Phenomema #1: Weekend vs Weekday Data
The first phenomena found in the data relates to how weekday (Monday-Thursday) ride activity varies from weekend (Friday-Sunday) activity. in order to show the main differences, I chose to examine the total trips across all of the days of the weeks and the the top start stations ride activity depending on whether it was a weekday or a weekend. 

The first visual, Total Trips, shows that the majority of rides occur on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. This indicates that more people are using citibikes during the weekends compared to weekdays. The company could consider premium prices for weekend traffic. 

The next 2 visuals, Top Start Station Weekdays and Top Start Station Weekends show total ride acivity broken down by the station name that the ride was started at. The Weekdays visual is filtered on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday while the Weekends visual is filtered on Friday, Saturday, and Sundat. The visuals help us relaize that the Grove St PATH and South Waterfront Walkway are the 2 most used start stations. This could indicate that these two stations should be expanded due to high traffic and need. Additionally, this highlights the phenomena that depending on the day of the week, the popularity of a station varies.

Phenomena #2: Time of Day Data

This phenomena highlights how ride activity varies throughout the day. To examine the data more closely, the data has been split into 3 sections of the day 8am, 3pm, and 8pm to illustrate morning, afternoon, and evening.

The first visual, Morning Rides 8am, shows how many rides were started at 8am throughout the month of October. This illusration highlights that the ride activity greatly varies in the mornings depending on the day in the month. It also shows that the maximum rides at 8am ranges between 13-246 rides. 

The second visual, Afternoon Rides 3pm, shows how many rides were started at 3pm throughout the month of October. This illusration highlights that the ride activity does not vary too much in the afternoon depending on the day in the month. It also shows that the range of rides at 3pm is about 100-300 rides. 

The third visual, Evening Rides 8pm, shows how many rides were started at 8pm throughout the month of October. This illusration highlights that the ride activity greatly varies in the evening depending on the day in the month. It also shows that the range of rides at 3pm is about 21-203 rides. 

All three of these visuals together show that ride activity is highest in the afternoon hours of the day while morning and evenings vary. With this in mind, next steps could be to investigate which stations are most popular in the morning and evening time frame and determine ways to increase ride acivity in the morning/evening. A hypothesis as to why mornings/evenings are not as popular could be due to weather- as it gets colder in Jersey City, people would be less likely to bike when they could instead call a cab or drive. Ideas to increase ride activity in the morning or evening may be to lower prices in those time frames, or offer promotions for completing rides in those time frames.


Official Requested Map Analysis: 
Here is the official requested map. This map shows all CitiBike Stations in Jersey City. With the data provided, we are able to visually depict the number of rides per station on the map. On the map, notice the darker the circles, the more popular the stations are. 

From the map, we can see that the closer we get to the water, the darker the spots- indicating the more popular the stations are. Additionally, we can notice that there are more stations in general as we get closer to the water. 

With this in mind, for next steps, it may make sense to take a deeper dive into understanding why certain stations are more popular than others even though many stations are very close to each other.
